# Alacr√°n UI Build 9052020

## Description
A front end css framework forked on Metro UI CSS V3.

The live version [is here](http://hyperyaentertainment.rf.gd/alacran/), thanks to [Hyperya Entertainment](https://www.facebook.com/HyperyaEntertainment/) for giving hosting for this project.

## Is this complete?
No, I started this project on 2017 but stopped the development due to health reasons, but now I started again. And we are in the build 9052020

## How to contribute?
It's easy first you need to install Node.js, install the [http-server library](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) finally download the project in your machine

To run the http-server, go to the docs folder, open a terminal in there and run the command: `http-server` and here you go!

### Whant more?
check the [wiki](https://github.com/sutherland007/Alacran-CSS/wiki) for more info, I'll be updating the wiki ASAP

### Remember every change made to the css files need a server restart and a CTRL + F5 in the browser.

## This is the progress done so far:
