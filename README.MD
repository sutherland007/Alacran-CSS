# Alacr√°n UI Build 9052020

## Description
A front end css framework forked on Metro UI CSS V3.

The live version [is here](http://hyperyaentertainment.rf.gd/alacran/), thanks to [Hyperya Entertainment](https://www.facebook.com/HyperyaEntertainment/) for giving hosting for this project.

The rails app (still in development) [is here](https://alacran-ui.herokuapp.com/)
the rails app will implement and show all the components of this framework so you can
see them in action and how the perform in a real webapp.

## Is this complete?
No, I started this project on 2017 but stopped the development due to health reasons, but now I started again. And we are in the build 9052020

## How to contribute?
It's easy first you need to install Node.js, install the [http-server library](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) finally download the project in your machine

To run the http-server, go to the docs folder, open a terminal in there and run the command: `http-server` and here you go!

### The future of this project.
The new build will be ALR012K21
We are going to make it modular, that means if you want to only use the menu bars on your project that's it, on import the menu bars without importing the whole framework.

### Whant more?
check the [wiki](https://github.com/sutherland007/Alacran-CSS/wiki) for more info, I'll be updating the wiki ASAP

### Remember every change made to the css files need a server restart and a CTRL + F5 in the browser.

## This is the progress done so far:
